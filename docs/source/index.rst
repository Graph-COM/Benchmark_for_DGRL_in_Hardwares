Welcome to DGRL-Hardware's documentation!
===================================

DGRL-Hardware is a toolbox for benchmarking directed graph representation learning (DGRL) in hardwares, involving DGRL model configuration, hyper-parameter auto-tuning, and evaluation on our selected datasets/tasks from the hardware design loop.

The toolbox is built based on `Pytorch 2.0 <https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/>`_, `PyTorch Geometric <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io>`_, `PyTorch Geometric Signed and Directed <https://pytorch-geometric-signed-directed.readthedocs.io>`_, `RAY Tune <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html>`_ .

   This project is under active development.
