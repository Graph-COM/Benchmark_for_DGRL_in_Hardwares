Welcome to DGRL-Hardware's documentation!
===================================

Here we provide a toolbox for directed graph representation learning (DGRL) in hardwares, involving DGRL model configuration, hyper-parameter auto-tuning, methods evaluation on 5 existing datasets/tasks from the hardware design loop.

The toolbox is built based on Pytorch, PyTorch Geometric, RAY.

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients. Lumache hosts its documentation on Read the Docs.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
