Data Process for PyG format
============================

To process the data, we provide examples of DataProcessors on processing all the tasks into PyG.Data format, the codes are provided in `./data_processpr <https://github.com/peterwang66/Benchmark_for_DGRL_in_Hardwares/tree/main/DGRL-Hardware/data_processor>`_.

Here we provide the implementation of adding the magnetic laplacian PE as a pre-transform of the data. Please see `obtain PE <>`_ for details.
